# How to play Awale (Oware) — Quick Tutorial

This short tutorial explains the basic mechanics of Awale (also called Oware). It's a cleaned, concise version of the in-repo tutorial.

Board setup
- 2 rows × 6 pits = 12 pits total.
- 48 seeds total, 4 seeds in each pit at the start.
- Each player controls the 6 pits on their side.

Objective
- Capture more seeds than your opponent. 25+ captured seeds is an immediate win.

Basic turn (pick up, sow, capture)
1. Pick one of your pits that contains at least one seed and remove all seeds from it.
2. Sow the seeds one-by-one in counterclockwise order (one seed per pit). If you circle the board, skip the originating pit on subsequent laps.
3. If your last seed lands in an opponent pit that now contains exactly 2 or 3 seeds, capture those seeds. Continue capturing backwards across consecutive opponent pits while each contains 2 or 3 seeds.

Feeding rule (important)
- You must not play a move that leaves your opponent with zero seeds if you have an alternative move that would leave them with seeds.
- If no alternative exists, the move that starves the opponent is permitted and the game ends per agreed variant.

Example
1. Suppose opponent pits (from left-to-right) are: [1,2,3,4,2,1] and you pick a pit that results in your last seed landing on the opponent's pit with 1 seed.
2. That pit becomes 2 → captured. Check the previous opponent pit: if it is 2 or 3, capture it too, and so on.

End of game
- A player reaches 25+ captured seeds.
- A player has no seeds and the opponent cannot feed them (then collect remaining seeds per variant).
- An agreed draw or endless loop is handled by splitting seeds by side or other tournament rules.
