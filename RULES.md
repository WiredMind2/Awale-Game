# Awale / Oware — Rules

These are a clear, unambiguous statement of the commonly used rules for Awale (Oware). There are small regional and tournament variants — choose one before play if you need absolute consistency.

## 1. Equipment and setup
- Board: 2 rows × 6 pits (houses) = 12 regular pits.
- Seeds: 48 seeds total. Each pit starts with 4 seeds.
- Each player controls the 6 pits on their side (the row nearest them).

## 2. Objective
- Capture more seeds than your opponent. A player who first reaches 25 or more captured seeds wins immediately.
- If both players finish with 24 seeds each, the result is a draw.

## 3. Turn sequence
On your turn perform three ordered steps: pick up, sow, then possibly capture.

### A. Pick up
- Choose one of your own pits that contains at least one seed and remove all seeds from it into your hand.
- You may not pick from an opponent pit.

### B. Sow
- Sow seeds one-by-one into subsequent pits moving counterclockwise (to your left).
- Place one seed per pit, including pits on your opponent’s side.
- If your sowing completes a full circuit and you still hold seeds, continue sowing; each time you pass the original pit (the pit you took seeds from) skip it — do not drop any seed into it on later laps.
- Continue until you have placed your last seed.

### C. Capture
- If the last seed you sowed lands in an opponent pit and that pit now contains exactly 2 or 3 seeds, you capture all seeds from that pit (they are removed from the board and added to your capture total).
- After capturing that pit, examine the immediately preceding pits in the opponent’s row (moving backwards toward the opponent’s right). For each consecutive opponent pit that also contains exactly 2 or 3 seeds, capture those as well. Stop when you encounter an opponent pit that does not contain exactly 2 or 3, or when you reach your own row.
- Captures only occur when the last seed lands in an opponent pit; sowing that ends in your own row does not trigger captures.

## 4. Special rules and illegal moves
### Feeding rule (do not starve the opponent)
- A move that would capture all seeds from the opponent’s side and leave them with no seeds to play is illegal if you have an alternative legal move that would leave them with seeds.
- If no such alternative move exists, the move that leaves the opponent empty is permitted and the game ends; remaining seeds are typically awarded to the player who made the last legal move (see variants below).

### Multiple laps / skipping origin
- When sowing wraps around the board more than once, always skip the originating pit on subsequent laps.

### Other practical rules
- You may only pick up seeds from your own pits.
- Moves are final once completed.
- If an illegal move is played and discovered immediately, revert to the previous position if both players agree; in formal tournaments apply the tournament penalty rules.

## 5. End of game
The game ends when one of the following occurs:
- A player captures 25 or more seeds — that player wins immediately.
- A player has no seeds on their side and cannot move. If the opponent can make a move that will give seeds to the empty player, they must do so if possible. If the opponent cannot (no such move exists), the game ends and remaining seeds are collected according to the agreed variant (commonly awarded to the player who still has seeds).
- Players agree the game has entered an endless loop with no further captures. In that case remaining seeds are usually split by side: each player keeps the seeds on their own row.

At the end, compare capture totals: the higher total wins; 24–24 is a draw.

## 6. Clarifications and common variants
- Maximum capture: Standard rules capture consecutive opponent pits that meet the 2-or-3 condition when checked backwards — there is no built-in fixed 5-pit cap in most common rules.
- Who collects leftover seeds when play ends because a player cannot move: some rule sets give them to the player who still has seeds; others split by side. State your variant before play.
- Whether backward capture checking continues into your own row: most rules stop when your own row is reached.
- Tournament rules may be stricter about illegal moves and about how to adjudicate repeating positions.

## 7. Quick player checklist
- Pick only from your own non-empty pits.
- Sow counterclockwise, one seed per pit; skip the originating pit on subsequent laps.
- Capture only if the last seed lands in an opponent pit that now has exactly 2 or 3 seeds; continue capturing backwards across opponent pits while they hold 2 or 3 seeds.
- Do not play a move that starves the opponent if a legal alternative exists.

If you prefer, I can adapt these for a specific variant (Ghanaian, Dutch/tournament) or add a short illustrated example of a turn showing a capture chain.
