# Codebase Cleanup and Testing - Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Removed Old Monolithic Code
- **Deleted**: `awale_server.c` and `awale_client.c` (legacy fork-based implementations)
- **Impact**: Codebase now uses only the modular architecture
- **Benefits**: Eliminates confusion about which system to use, reduces maintenance burden

### 2. ✅ Fixed Known Bugs
- **Message Size Bug**: Fixed `handle_list_players()` in `src/server/main.c`
  - **Problem**: Was sending `sizeof(msg_player_list_t)` = ~14,600 bytes for full 100-player array
  - **Solution**: Now calculates actual size: `sizeof(list.count) + (count * sizeof(player_info_t))`
  - **Impact**: Reduces network traffic by 99% when few players connected

### 3. ✅ Full Migration to Bidirectional Communication
- **Removed**: Single-socket backward compatibility layer from `connection.h/c`
- **Updated**: All `connection_*()` functions now require two ports (read_port, write_port)
- **Simplified**: Removed redundant `connection_*_bidirectional()` wrapper functions
- **API Changes**:
  ```c
  // OLD (removed)
  connection_create_server(&conn, 2000);  // Single port
  connection_connect_bidirectional(&conn, host, 2000, 2001);  // Wrapper function
  
  // NEW (current)
  connection_create_server(&conn, 2000, 2001);  // Always two ports
  connection_connect(&conn, host, 2000, 2001);  // Standard function
  ```

### 4. ✅ Comprehensive Test Suite
Created two test suites with 33 total tests (all passing):

#### Game Logic Tests (`tests/test_game_logic.c`) - 16 tests
- **Board Operations** (6 tests):
  - Board initialization with correct starting state
  - Simple move execution and sowing
  - Capture mechanics (2 and 3 seeds)
  - No capture in own row
  - Win condition at 25+ seeds
  
- **Rules Validation** (7 tests):
  - Empty pit detection
  - Wrong side detection
  - Turn validation
  - Feeding rule violation with alternatives
  - Feeding rule allowance without alternatives
  - Capture chain mechanics
  - Skip origin pit on lap
  
- **Player Management** (3 tests):
  - Player initialization
  - Pseudo validation (alphanumeric + underscore/hyphen only)
  - Win/loss statistics tracking

#### Network Layer Tests (`tests/test_network.c`) - 17 tests
- **Serialization** (6 tests):
  - int32, string, bool serialization/deserialization
  - Message header serialization
  - Full message serialization
  - Correct message size calculation
  
- **Connection Management** (2 tests):
  - Connection initialization
  - Connection state checking
  
- **Select Multiplexing** (2 tests):
  - Select context initialization
  - File descriptor registration
  
- **Protocol** (2 tests):
  - Message type to string conversion
  - Error code to string conversion
  
- **Message Structures** (3 tests):
  - Connection message structure
  - Play move message structure
  - Board state message structure
  
- **Buffer Safety** (2 tests):
  - Buffer overflow prevention
  - Message size limits

### 5. ✅ Build System Integration
Updated `Makefile` with test targets:
```bash
make test         # Run all tests
make test-game    # Run game logic tests only
make test-network # Run network layer tests only
```

### 6. ✅ Updated AI Agent Instructions
Enhanced `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:
- Added section on automated testing (preferred over manual testing)
- Documented AI agent limitations (cannot manage multiple terminals)
- Removed references to deleted legacy files
- Clarified that bidirectional communication is the only system now
- Added note about avoiding interactive command-line testing

## Test Results

```
Game Logic Tests: 16/16 passed ✓
Network Tests:    17/17 passed ✓
Total:            33/33 passed ✓
```

## Benefits

### For Developers
- **Clearer Architecture**: No confusion about which code to use
- **Better Testing**: Automated tests catch bugs immediately
- **Faster Development**: Don't need to manually test with multiple terminals
- **More Reliable**: Tests verify critical functionality (feeding rule, captures, message sizes)

### For AI Agents
- **No Manual Testing**: Can verify changes using `make test` automatically
- **Clear Instructions**: Updated documentation guides AI agents away from multi-terminal testing
- **Simpler Codebase**: Only one architecture to understand

### For Code Quality
- **Bug Prevention**: The message size bug is now tested and can't regress
- **Validation**: Game rules are thoroughly tested
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable examples

## Next Steps (Future Work)

1. **Integration Tests**: Create end-to-end tests that simulate full client-server interactions
2. **Performance Tests**: Measure throughput with bidirectional sockets vs theoretical maximum
3. **Stress Tests**: Test with many concurrent clients and games
4. **CI/CD**: Set up GitHub Actions to run tests on every commit
5. **Coverage**: Measure and improve code coverage

## Files Changed

### Deleted
- `awale_server.c` (622 LOC)
- `awale_client.c` (560 LOC)

### Modified
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Updated instructions for AI agents
- `include/network/connection.h` - Removed backward compatibility layer
- `src/network/connection.c` - Simplified to bidirectional-only
- `src/server/main.c` - Fixed message size bug
- `Makefile` - Added test targets

### Created
- `tests/test_game_logic.c` - 16 comprehensive game logic tests
- `tests/test_network.c` - 17 comprehensive network layer tests

## Command-Line Usage

### Server
The server uses a **discovery port** and automatically negotiates bidirectional ports:
```bash
./build/awale_server [discovery_port]

# Examples:
./build/awale_server           # Uses default discovery port 12345
./build/awale_server 8080      # Uses custom discovery port 8080
```

**How it works:**
1. Server listens on discovery port (default: 12345)
2. Client connects to discovery port
3. Server finds two free ports and sends them to client
4. Both switch to bidirectional communication on the new ports

### Client
The client only needs **hostname and pseudo**, optionally a discovery port:
```bash
./build/awale_client <host> <read_port> <write_port> <pseudo>

# Examples:
./build/awale_client localhost Alice           # Connects to default port 12345
./build/awale_client 192.168.1.100 Bob 8080   # Custom discovery port
```

### Make Targets
```bash
make run-server                    # Runs server on default discovery port (12345)
make run-server DISCOVERY_PORT=8080  # Custom discovery port
make run-client PSEUDO=Alice       # Connects to default port
make test                          # Run all automated tests
```

## Verification

To verify all changes work correctly:
```bash
make clean
make test
make server
make client
```

All tests pass, and both server and client compile without warnings or errors.
